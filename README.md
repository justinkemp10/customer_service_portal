    As a business who serves customers
    I WANT to be able to interact with my customers to review their experiences
    SO THAT I can provide the best products and service to meet my customer needs.


## Initialization
- Download project files via Github
- Open server.js file and change the password field to your own MySQL password
- Open Terminal and proceed to type "npm install"
- From here we will move to our database so type "cd db/" then type "mysql -u root -p" and enter your personal password. Now we will type "source schema.sql" and "source seeds.sql" 
- To exit MySQL we will type "exit" then proceed to type "npm run start"
- Now you can view the database and add or remove things
