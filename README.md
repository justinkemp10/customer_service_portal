## Description
This application is a customer service experience app that is designed for businesses to use to track individual customer service requests for their customers. Once a customer signs up, they are given access to create & submit a customer service ticket. They are presented with a form to fill out and when it's completed, the ticket is generated and added to their "Current Tickets" list. 

Further development will include administrative credentials that allow the business to respond to tickets and interact with their customers directly.

## User Story
